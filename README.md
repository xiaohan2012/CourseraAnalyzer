CourseraAnalyzer
================

A data analyzing program for the statistics generated from coursera.org

This program attempts to help us understand:

1. basic statistics of coursera, such as the courses provided by each university/taught by each instructor.
2. how different interests of an individual correlate with each other? Is there a pattern that people who likes **A** tends to like **B** ?
3. whether age/nationality/gender has anything to do with people's interest?
4. to be continued
